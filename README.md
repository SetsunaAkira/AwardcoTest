# AwardcoTest
Assessment test for AwardCo

I installed Node.js version 14.17.6
To be exact, I created a folder for the test, in cmd prompt in it I ran NPM init -y to create the node modules in the test and the packages.json, I then installed Cypress into the folder using NPM i Cypress to create the Cypress Folder and cypress.json. I opened up the folder in VS Code to get access to the cypress example files and where i put in my test, I wasn't sure if all you needed was my spec.js file so I just put in the the whole Cypress folder not including the example files. I opened Cypress using npx open Cypress on cmd prompt and my test file appeared in the application and thats where I ran it.

I named my spec.js "awardcotest.spec.js"

I started Roughly at noon when I opened the link.
it took me about 20 minutes to setup and install the things into my project folder.
it took me roughly 30 - 40 minutes to understand how to use cypress in JS just to understand the syntax.
I started exploring the example test to understand how Cypress does things alongside understanding the syntax.
I then started my own exploratory testing against Award.co to understand what I can and cannot do with Cypress.
I would say I started formulating and coding my tests at around 1:30 PM.
I finished writing 3 test at around 3:30 PM.
