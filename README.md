# AwardcoTest
Assessment test for AwardCo

I installed Node.js version 14.17.6
NPM init the selected folder.
then npm install Cypress.
then npx open Cypress to open the application.

I used Visual Studio Code to both create the test Suite and look at the example tests.
I added my own test folder in the Integrations folder right next to the example tests.
I named my test awardcotest.spec.js.

I started Roughly at noon when I opened the link.
it took me about 20 minutes to setup and install the things into my project folder.
it took me roughly 30 - 40 minutes to understand how to use cypress in JS just to understand the syntax.
I started exploring the example test to understand how Cypress does things alongside understanding the syntax.
I then started my own exploratory testing against Award.co to understand what I can and cannot do with Cypress.
I would say I started formulating and coding my tests at around 1:30 PM.
I finished writing 3 test at around 3:30 PM.
