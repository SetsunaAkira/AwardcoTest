# AwardcoTest
Assessment test for AwardCo

I installed Node.js version 14.17.6
To be exact, I created a folder for the test, in cmd prompt in it I ran NPM init -y to create the node modules in the test and the packages.json, I then installed Cypress into the folder using NPM i Cypress to create the Cypress Folder and cypress.json. I opened up the folder in VS Code to get access to the cypress example files and where i put in my test, I wasn't sure if all you needed was my spec.js file so I just put in the the whole Cypress folder not including the example files. I opened Cypress using npx open Cypress on cmd prompt and my test file appeared in the application and thats where I ran it.

I named my spec.js "awardcotest.spec.js"

I started Roughly at noon when I opened the link.
it took me about 20 minutes to setup and install the things into my project folder.
it took me roughly 30 - 40 minutes to understand how to use cypress in JS just to understand the syntax.
I started exploring the example test to understand how Cypress does things alongside understanding the syntax.
I then started my own exploratory testing against Award.co to understand what I can and cannot do with Cypress.
I would say I started formulating and coding my tests at around 1:30 PM.
I finished writing 3 test at around 3:30 PM.

Im gonna be honest here, if that was the live environment for the website, the HTML Structure needs alot of work, I spend a good bit of time in the coding part just trying to find a way to select the correct element because there aren't unique identifiers for elements, the class names are completely identical to others, and theres no other element that allowed me to find a easy to to know i selected the right element. in the Products tab why is it that every single image was labeled as "Logo-Black" or "Logo-White" and there was no other unique identifier for those logos aside from the alt except for the Even product which for some reason wasnt the same as any of the other logos.
